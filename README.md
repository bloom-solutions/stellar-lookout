[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/imacchiato/stellar_lookout.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/imacchiato/stellar_lookout)

Almost all actions in the app run in jobs. Almost all jobs are triggered by a schedue, or by other jobs, to make work more atomic.

Documentation is still under development. See `app/controllers/api/v1/wards_controller.rb`.
